Asynchronous Thrift Extension for C++

Features:
1. generating asynchronous RPC client code
  1.1. asynchronous RPC with timeout
  1.2. asynchronous RPC client with synchronous RPC
2. full compatibility with the official thrift
3. full boost.asio implementation
4. asynchronous thrift server


Installation and Usage:
1. cp thrift_0.5.0_patch/t_cpp_generator.cc ${thrift}/compiler/cpp/src/generate/
2. rebuild thrift compiler(only the sub-directory "compiler/cpp" is enough)
3. re-compile your thrift files with the newly-compiled thrift compiler
4. include "lib/AsyncThriftClient.cpp lib/AsyncThriftClient.h" to your project
   or
   prebuild "lib/AsyncThriftClient.cpp" and link your program against it


Limitations:
thrift server must use TFramedTransport and TBinaryProtocol


TODO:
support for thrift-0.7.0
