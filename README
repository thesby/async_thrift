Asynchronous Thrift Extension for C++

Features:
1. generating asynchronous RPC client code
2. full compatibility with the official thrift(both binary interface and RPC code)
3. full boost.asio implementation
4. asynchronous thrift server


Installation and Usage:
1. cp thrift_0.5.0_patch/t_cpp_generator.cc ${thrift}/compiler/cpp/src/generate/
2. rebuild thrift compiler(only the sub-directory "compiler/cpp" is enough)
3. re-compile your thrift files with the newly-compiled thrift compiler
4. build libasync_thrift.a(so)


Limitations:
asynchronous thrift client and server must use TFramedTransport and TBinaryProtocol
AsyncThriftServer does not support oneway functions


TODO:
support for thrift-0.7.0
