# The API version (NOT the product version), composed as a dot delimited
# string with major, minor, and patch level components.
#
#  - Major: Incremented for backward incompatible changes. An example would
#           be changes to the number or disposition of method arguments.
#  - Minor: Incremented for backward compatible changes. An example would
#           be the addition of a new (optional) method.
#  - Patch: Incremented for bug fixes. The patch level should be increased
#           for every edit that doesn't result in a change to major/minor.
#
# See the Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) http://semver.org.
